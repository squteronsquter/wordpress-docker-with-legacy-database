# WordPress Docker with Legacy Database Project

This time we have a database to import to our local WordPress Docker installation.

In my docker-compose file all evironment data are sample, so just adjust them to fit your own requirements (eg. passwords)

This time also we wnt to have a shared synced folder between you docker installation and the focal folder form which you run **docker-compose** commands

We will install it with the help of docker-compose.yml file

And then just run:

`docker-compose up`

inside the folder where you want

If you want to tear down anything that went not so well or have just added some new instructions to the docker-compose.yml file

`docker-compose rm`

**Happy Coding**
